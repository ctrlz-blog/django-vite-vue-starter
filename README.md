# django-vite-vue-starter

A starter project using Django, Vite and Vue where Vue is used inside Django templates instead of its own application.

This repository was created for my Vite tutorial series.

### [The Django Developer's Guide to Vite](https://ctrlzblog.com/the-django-developers-guide-to-vite/)
Introduction to Vite and how you can install it in a Django project. Uses the django-vite package to link Django templates with the Vite static file server.
 
### [Using Vue with Django Templates](https://ctrlzblog.com/add-vue-to-your-django-templates-with-vite/)
